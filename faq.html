  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Is Ava a real person?</h2>
  <p>No. Ava is an AI companion powered by advanced language models. She is not a real person. While conversations with Ava are designed to feel natural and personal, all of her responses are generated by artificial intelligence.</p>

  <h2>How does Ava remember me?</h2>
  <p>Ava saves context from your conversations so she can reference things you've told her before. The more you talk to her, the better she gets at understanding you and your preferences. Your conversation history is stored securely and used only to personalize your experience.</p>

  <h2>What can I talk to Ava about?</h2>
  <p>Anything. Ava is your companion for conversation — whether you want to vent about your day, flirt, get advice, talk through a decision, or just have someone to chat with. She's designed to match your energy and keep things interesting.</p>

  <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
  <p>AvaTexts offers a limited number of free messages to get started. For unlimited access, the subscription is $20/month. New subscribers get a 7-day free trial. You can cancel anytime before the trial ends to avoid being charged.</p>

  <h2>How do I cancel my subscription?</h2>
  <p>Manage your subscription through the login portal on our website. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period — you'll continue to have access until then.</p>

  <h2>Does this work on Android?</h2>
  <p>AvaTexts is currently available on iPhone only through iMessage. Android support is not available at this time.</p>

  <h2>Is my data private?</h2>
  <p>Yes. Your conversations with Ava are private. We do not sell your personal data. Message content is processed by AI providers solely to generate Ava's responses and is not used for advertising or shared with third parties for marketing purposes. For full details, see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>How old do I have to be to use AvaTexts?</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.</p>
