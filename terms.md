# Terms of Service

### Last updated: February 2026

Welcome to AvaTexts ("AvaTexts," "we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AvaTexts website (avatexts.com), the Ava AI companion messaging service, and any related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement. We reserve the right to terminate accounts of any users we reasonably believe to be under 18.

## 2. Description of Service

AvaTexts provides an AI-powered companion chatbot accessible through iMessage. Ava is an artificial intelligence — she is not a real person. All conversations are generated by AI language models. While Ava is designed to be engaging, personalized, and conversational, she is not a substitute for real human relationships.

## 3. AI Disclaimer

You acknowledge and understand that:

- Ava is an AI companion, not a real person.
- Responses are generated by AI and may sometimes be inaccurate, inappropriate, or inconsistent.
- Ava may not always remember previous conversations accurately.
- AvaTexts does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or appropriateness of any AI-generated content.

## 4. No Medical, Therapeutic, or Professional Advice

The Service is provided for entertainment and companionship purposes only. AvaTexts does not provide medical, psychological, therapeutic, legal, financial, or any other professional advice. The Service is not a substitute for professional diagnosis, treatment, or counseling.

If you are experiencing a medical or mental health emergency, contact 911 or your local emergency services immediately. In the U.S., you can also dial 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

You are solely responsible for your own actions, well-being, and any decisions made in connection with your use of the Service.

## 5. Account and Access

By providing your phone number to access the Service, you agree that this serves as your account identifier. You are responsible for maintaining the security of access to your device and phone number. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

## 6. Fees, Payments, and Subscriptions

### 6.1 Free Access

The Service may offer a limited number of free messages. The availability and limits of free access are subject to change at our sole discretion without notice.

### 6.2 Paid Subscription

Full access to the Service requires a paid subscription at $20.00 per month. We may offer a 7-day free trial for new subscribers. Payment is processed through Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize us and our payment processor to charge the applicable fees to your selected payment method.

### 6.3 Automatic Renewal

Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless canceled before the renewal date. You are responsible for canceling your subscription before the next billing cycle to avoid additional charges.

### 6.4 Refunds

All purchases are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Canceling a subscription prevents future charges but does not entitle you to a refund for the current billing period. We may, at our sole discretion, issue refunds in cases of verified duplicate charges or technical errors.

### 6.5 Price Changes

All prices are subject to change. We will provide reasonable notice of any price changes before your next billing cycle.
