# FAQ

## Is Ava a real person?

No. Ava is an AI companion powered by advanced language models. She is not a real person. While conversations with Ava are designed to feel natural and personal, all of her responses are generated by artificial intelligence.

## How does Ava remember me?

Ava saves context from your conversations so she can reference things you've told her before. The more you talk to her, the better she gets at understanding you and your preferences. Your conversation history is stored securely and used only to personalize your experience.

## What can I talk to Ava about?

Anything. Ava is your companion for conversation — whether you want to vent about your day, flirt, get advice, talk through a decision, or just have someone to chat with. She's designed to match your energy and keep things interesting.
